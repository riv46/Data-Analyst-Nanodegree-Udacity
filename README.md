# [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

This repository has all the project that I did during the Udacity Nanodegree in Data Analytics.

This Nanodegree is divided in 2 terms:

## First Term
[**P1: Explore Weather Trends**](https://github.com/riv46/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/First_Term/p1_explore_weather_trends)\
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

[**P2: Explore US Bikeshare Data**](https://github.com/riv46/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/First_Term/p2_explore_US_bikeshare_data)\
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the USA.  I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 

[**P3: Investigate a Dataset**](https://github.com/riv46/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/First_Term/p3_investigate_a_dataset)\
In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicate the findings of it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier.

[**P4: Analyze A/B Test Results**](https://github.com/riv46/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/First_Term/p4_ab_testing)\
In this project, I explore the results of an A/B test run by an eCommerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page or keep the old page.

## Second Term
[**P5: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon**](https://github.com/riv46/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/Second_Term/p5_test_a_perceptual_phenomenon)\
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I learned a little bit about the experiment, created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task. I looked at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted the results in terms of my hypotheses.

[**P6: Explore and Summarize Data**](https://github.com/riv46/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/Second_Term/p6_explore_and_summarize_data)\
In this project, I used R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

[**P7: Wrangle and Analyze Data**](https://github.com/riv46/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/Second_Term/p7_wrangle_analyze_data)\
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. I documented the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

[**P8: Create Tableau Story**](https://github.com/riv46/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/Second_Term/p8_create_a_tableau_story)\
In this project, I created a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. My work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
